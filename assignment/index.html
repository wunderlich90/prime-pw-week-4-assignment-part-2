        <h3>I am currently rocking the minivan because I have kids to haul around!
          I couldn't live without CarPlay so I had a stereo installed that has the
          CarPlay feature. The back of this vehicle is currently full of beach gear
          so as to be ever ready for that impromptu trip to the lake! All in all,
          not a bad mode of transportation.</h3>
